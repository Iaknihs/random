# random/unsorted
This is a (mostly python) repo I am filling with any any scripts I 
create without a larger project in mind.
This includes __practice__ tasks I find on the internet and solve,
because I can; but also small __tools__ and __utils__ (basically a 
function library) I develop to help me with any tasks I'm dealing with
at the time.

If anything requires explanation beyond the pydocs, I'll probably
add a README to the specific directory.
